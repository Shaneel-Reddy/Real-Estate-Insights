# Real Estate Insights
This Real Estate Insights project is a machine learning application that predicts house prices in Banglore based on various features like location, size, and number of bedrooms. The application preprocesses the data, handles missing values, performs outlier removal, and uses different regression models to predict house prices.
Achieved a performance score of approximately 86% using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for the best model.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and performs feature engineering.
Price Prediction: Uses linear regression, Lasso regression, and decision tree regression to predict house prices.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates models using cross-validation and grid search to find the best model with optimal parameters.

## Technologies Used
Python
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
